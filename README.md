# Programming-Fundamentals-2
My final project for Programming Fundamentals 2 <br>
This project is a simple CRUD system for a scouting group. <br>
The user can create, display, update and delete Scouts. <br>
The user can list scouts by gender and their scouting division, you can also search scouts by name. <br>
The scouts and divisions can be saved to an external xml file and can be loaded back into the program <br>
The user can use the program to calculate the annual fees of all scouts.<br>
